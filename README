Query Magic the Gathering card data (stored in XML) using Python expressions.

Will write docs and such later. Code is very "dirty" right now, must be
cleaned up first. 

It's gonna take a while, but eventually this should be more powerful than
Gatherer or MagicCards.info. It should also be the first MtG search engine
that can find, say, all cards with flying, all instants that grant trample,
all creatures that produce green mana, or all creatures with protection from
red... just to name a few things. (No, you cannot reliably do this by
searching the rules text.)
