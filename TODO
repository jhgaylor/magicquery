# TODO

There are many, many things we can add. Here are a few ideas:

GENERAL:

    - add configuration options and command line options

    - add a way to set options at the prompt

CARD METHODS/ATTRIBUTES:

    - name_match() etc, that match against regular expressions

    - once we have keyword data: attribute('flying') etc.

    - hybrid mana, snow mana

    - handle X spells

    - handle power/toughness "*"

OUTPUT:

    - can be redirected or written directly to file, if desired

    - can be in other formats (XML, HTML, whatevs)

    - users should be able to specify custom print functions for both output
      on screen, and to file

COMMAND LINE:

    - add a way to display all info we have about a certain card, e.g.

      > ?Sliver Queen
      ...prints all data for this card...

    - 

FARFETCHED:

    - add rules and search them
    - add banned/restricted lists and use them as search criteria
