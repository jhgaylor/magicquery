# TODO

There are many, many things we can add. Here are a few ideas:

GENERAL:

    - add configuration options and command line options

    - add a way to set options at the prompt

    - right now '?' shows the oracle type/rules; there should also be an easy
      way to show the originals.

CARD METHODS/ATTRIBUTES:

    - once we have keyword data: attribute('flying') etc.
      [in progress]

    - some/all of the keywords could be properties, e.g. we could support
      "flying" instead of "has('flying')"
      [2010.10.31] Probably not, there are too many of them, and some of them
      clash with a more useful use of the name (see protection below)

    - some keywords have additional info, e.g. we should be able to do
      "protection('white')" etc. (although this clashes with a potential
      property called 'protection'... but we can use has('protection')
      instead.) ditto for mana, etc. mana is especially interesting, since I
      want to be able to say, show all cards that produce (at least) G, show
      all cards that produce colorless mana, etc.

    - snow mana?

    - we should still be able to "pick apart" hybrid mana (e.g. show cards
      that have R/W hybrid mana; this is NOT the same as "has_hybrid_mana and
      white and red").  Also 2/X hybrids.

    - in general, we need to be able to select more precisely on mana cost,
      anyway. "card has X in its mana cost", etc.

    - do we need to do anything special for X spells?

    - some keywords have TWO arguments, e.g. reinforce (as seen in MOR). we
      currently have no way to query both arguments.

OUTPUT:

    - can be redirected or written directly to file, if desired

    - can be in other formats (XML, HTML, whatevs)

    - users should be able to specify custom print functions for both output
      on screen, and to file

COMMAND LINE:


KEYWORDS:

    - keep a list of cards that we already added keywords for. filter out
      those cards somehow before we apply the keywords of a next set.
      [may not apply for some cards, trickier than it seems]


PROGRAMMABLE:

    - since everything is in Python, programmers could hack up quick scripts
      to access or manipulate the card database in ways that are difficult or
      impossible using the command line and the query language. let's make
      sure all the relevant code is accessible and obvious to use.
      (IOW, have a reasonable API)

FARFETCHED:

    - add rules and search them
    - add banned/restricted lists and use them as search criteria

DOCUMENTATION:

    - start writing a tutorial and/or manual... with lots of examples...
