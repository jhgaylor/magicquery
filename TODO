# TODO

There are many, many things we can add. Here are a few ideas:

GENERAL:

    - add configuration options and command line options

    - add a way to set options at the prompt

    - right now '?' shows the oracle type/rules; there should also be an easy
      way to show the originals.

CARD METHODS/ATTRIBUTES:

    - once we have keyword data: attribute('flying') etc.
      [in progress]

    - some/all of the keywords could be properties, e.g. we could support
      "flying" instead of "has('flying')"
      [2010.10.31] Probably not, there are too many of them, and some of them
      clash with a more useful use of the name (see protection below)

    - some keywords have additional info, e.g. we should be able to do
      "protection('white')" etc. (although this clashes with a potential
      property called 'protection'... but we can use has('protection')
      instead.) ditto for mana, etc. mana is especially interesting, since I
      want to be able to say, show all cards that produce (at least) G, show
      all cards that produce colorless mana, etc.

    - snow mana?

    - we should still be able to "pick apart" hybrid mana (e.g. show cards
      that have R/W hybrid mana; this is NOT the same as "has_hybrid_mana and
      white and red").  Also 2/X hybrids.

    - in general, we need to be able to select more precisely on mana cost,
      anyway. "card has X in its mana cost", etc.

    - do we need to do anything special for X spells?

    - some keywords have TWO arguments, e.g. reinforce (as seen in MOR). we
      currently have no way to query both arguments.

OUTPUT:

    - can be redirected or written directly to file, if desired

    - can be in other formats (XML, HTML, whatevs)

    - users should be able to specify custom print functions for both output
      on screen, and to file

COMMAND LINE:


    - there should be options that can be set from the command line, e.g. set
      the default output format, only list the same card once in a result set,
      etc.

    - it should be possible to enter simple "group by" queries from the
      command line. not sure how yet. :-) I want to be able to group by color,
      for example, and the program shows how many cards there are of each
      color. [maybe we should give it a predicate, and a list with values to
      try. in this case, we would give it has_color, then a list of colors. we
      could do the same with types, etc.]

    - add a query as a command line option

    - command line switch to get N random cards? (can be used in combination
      with queries, so we can get e.g. N random red creatures, etc)

    - in addition to the random stuff, we could do a "booster simulator",
      which gives you 15 cards (with the correct rarity distributions), like
      you would get them in a booster pack


KEYWORDS:

    - keep a list of cards that we already added keywords for. filter out
      those cards somehow before we apply the keywords of a next set.
      [may not apply for some cards, trickier than it seems]


SETS:

    - I want to be able to say 'set.online' if a set is available in MTGO, and
      'set.online_only' if it's _ONLY_ in MTGO (like Masters Edition etc).
      To do the former, we'd need a list of sets that are available in MTGO as
      well. Or maybe add a tag to magicripper's sets.py that indicates this.


PROGRAMMABLE:

    - since everything is in Python, programmers could hack up quick scripts
      to access or manipulate the card database in ways that are difficult or
      impossible using the command line and the query language. let's make
      sure all the relevant code is accessible and obvious to use.
      (IOW, have a reasonable API)

FARFETCHED:

    - add rules and search them
    - add banned/restricted lists and use them as search criteria

DOCUMENTATION:

    - start writing a tutorial and/or manual... with lots of examples...
