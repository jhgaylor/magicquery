# Informal progress report. Sort of.

2010-10-31: Added printed_type() and printed_subtype() methods:

$ python magicquery.py LEA LEB 4ED
975 cards in 3 files, loaded in 0.33s
> type('interrupt')
.........
> printed_type('interrupt')
.........
 1/42 [4ED] Blue Elemental Blast {U}
 2/42 [4ED] Chaoslace {R}
 3/42 [4ED] Counterspell {U}{U}
 4/42 [4ED] Dark Ritual {B}
 ...etc...

2010-11-29: magicquery.py now supports the -u/--unique option, which shows the
same card only once (by name).  Options will be added in the future to have
more control over this, e.g. determine which card is kept (the first found,
the earliest, the newest, etc), sorting options, and more.

2011-04-30: things to try for NPH:

> has_phyrexian_mana
> has_phyrexian_mana and green
> cmc == 5 and has_phyrexian_mana
> has('living-weapon')
